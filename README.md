phyllotaxis gradient

â†’ Combining p5.js  and Adobe Premiere Rush, phyllotaxis gradient visualizes the naturally occurring Fibonacci-based pattern. 
First, I used cos and sine values to create the design. Then, with this understanding of the structure, I proceeded to scale 
this pattern and replicate it across the screen. Next, I decided to display the Hue, Saturation, and Brightness and divide the project 
into six parts with hues varying between 60 values per sketch. Finally,  I screen-recorded each sketch, arranged them evenly in Premiere Pro, 
and sped up the duration of the video.
